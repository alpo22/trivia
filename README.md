AnecDOH!tes is a fun little Simpsons Quote trivia game, inspired by games like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) or [Framed](www.framed.wtf). Each day you will see five Simpsons quotes and it is up to you to identify who said which. Stats are stored locally. Share and compete with friends.

- improve quality of character images (get someone to make them a square)
  - is the game too hard? John got zero. Needs to be multiple choice?
- is free Vercel app too slow on cold start?
- on start, bring title forward (like does on the show), then make modal appear
- slide next question in from right
- can go back to previous questions
- could show most guessed incorrect answer
- use different state management
- the images at the end need to pre-load
- when click 'share' on last screen, copy should change to 'copied'
