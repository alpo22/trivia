AnecDOH!tes is a fun little Simpsons Quote trivia game, inspired by games like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) or [Framed](www.framed.wtf). Each day you will see five Simpsons quotes and it is up to you to identify who said which. Stats are stored locally. Share and compete with friends. Play here: [anecDOHtes.com](https://www.anecdohtes.com)

At it's peak, it had 900 players per day, but the more regular number was 100.
