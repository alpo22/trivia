## TODO:

- add character images from awais, adjust to fit in the centre of the circle
- proper domain anecdohtes.com (route 53)
- replace vercel URL with proper URL in game (constants.js)
- share with john wheeler
- back-end, just put in one week's few days worth of quotes, add one quote per character

## TODO Fanciness:

- add more quotes
- handle if there are no quotes returned from DB
- affiliate link to 'duff beer' on amazon
- if anyone plays it, need an ad... where?
- is free Vercel app too slow on cold start?
- on start, bring title forward (like does on the show), then make modal appear
- slide next question in from right
- can go back to previous questions
- could show most guessed incorrect answer
- use different state management
- the images at the end need to pre-load
- when click 'share' on last screen, copy should change to 'copied'
- show error/warning when submit without making a choice
- update the api path to / (in page.js). That didnt work in dev.
- you can cheat and look at the API response to see the answers...
