## TODO:

- when submit last question, the continue button then opens the modal

- awais is getting images of remaining 50 characters

- the images at the end need to go into assets
- the images at the end need to pre-load
- the images at the end need to be cleaned

- favicon
- track lifetime stats
- need an ad
- 4 rounds? 5?
- proper domain (route 53)
- back-end, just put in a few days worth of questions
- share with john wheeler

## TODO Fanciness:

- on start, bring title forward (like does on the show), then make modal appear

Identify who said the 5 simpsons quotes

- make 'share' button work (copy to clipboard, show toast)
- fetch today's quotes and who said them
- can go back to previous step (to see why wrong)

- stats modal content
- slide next question in from right
- could use better images with results, and add more text
- when click 'share' on last screen, copy should change to 'copied'
- can i get the simpsons ttf/otf font working instead of using images?
- can i close the 'results' at the end? cant refresh page
- show how they did this time vs their overall (localstorage, how many played, % of time got 100%, % of correct overall)
- could show most guessed incorrect answer
