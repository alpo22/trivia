## TODO:

- the images at the end need to pre-load
- the images at the end need to be cleaned
- the text at the end needs to be improved
- there may be fewer states for the last step if i reduce the # of rounds
- adjust character images to fit in the centre of the circle

- back-end, just put in a few days worth of questions
- if i have done it today, dont let me do it again
- track lifetime stats (localstorage)
- need an ad
- 4 rounds?
- proper domain (route 53)
- share with john wheeler
- show error/warning when submit without making a choice
- maybe i dont even need the "Rounds" component

## TODO Fanciness:

- on start, bring title forward (like does on the show), then make modal appear
- slide next question in from right
- can go back to previous questions
- could show most guessed incorrect answer
- use different state management
